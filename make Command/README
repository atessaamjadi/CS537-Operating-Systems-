This program is a replication of make. The program first looks for a makefile to parse. If not it looks for a Makefile. Parser.c parses the file into seperate 
'rules' that contain a target, possible dependencies, and commands. It prints the line number, an error message and the contents of the line if an error occurs du
ring parsing. In graph.c, we then create a graph of all these rules, by creating nodes for every target and file within the makefile/Makefile. We check for duplicate
targets and print an error message and exit if found. We do the same if a cycle is detected within the makefile/Makefile. If a user passes
in a valid target, main.c sends in only that arguemement to run its commands necessary to build the target. If no target is specified 
we run all the commands for all target and files needed to build the first target in the makefile/Makefile. A targets commands are run
when a dependency is out of date. process.c is called within graph.c to process commands.
